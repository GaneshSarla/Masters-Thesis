Nathan Davies,"I changed my review to tell everyone, absolutely do not spend money on this game!! Once you get to a certain level ,it's almost impossible to beat and most upgrades are unreachable unless you spend money, and that doesn't help. I'd give it a zero star rating if I could. I'm going to wait to delete it to get some of my money worth. Has potential if it wasn't set up to pay to simply move on to the next level. Disappointed all the way around.",10-11-2024 00:32,1,a0a387cd-4891-45a3-a872-1caec9b38663,TRUE,TRUE
Ryan F,"Each level you fight off zombies & acquire ""random"" upgrades throughout. The game withholds gun upgrades so you lose a lot. It's not random and offers everything BUT what you need to win. Played 15 matches, lost them all, no gun upgrades at all. So you burn energy and lose until you can't play or spend $$$. The game is SO SLOW and forces you to replay the same boring levels way too much. Upgrades take ages to aquire. UI is slow, cluttered, looks like garbage, not intuitive, and overall just bad.",15-08-2024 17:39,1,9b7d8ccb-f064-4989-91d6-2f633da8aeab,FALSE,TRUE
orion jacobs,"Not worth time or money. I do NOT support this game. Down voted and deleted. Tired of extreme power increase per stages and lack of power progression to play. Skill selection is too random, under powered and useless. Half the time the hired mercs are shooting at nothing or shooting behind them. Reported bug with skills aiming lower left of target 90% when at the gate and nothing is fixed or acknowledge.

Steve B,Been playing for about 2 months. Fun game but upgrading doesn't seem to make any difference. New levels are much harder than the previous so upgrading your gear and skills make very little difference. Game playability could be better if they made some clear-cut improvements. Players need to feel like they are progressing or they may feel its just a long grind for no reason.,07-08-2024 14:13,3,a703d257-1bcf-4eb7-9e2b-85a5f8b501da,FALSE,TRUE
Matthew Edward Campbell,Graphically this game is excellent. I really want to like this game but the balance is so poor 👎. It's not fun when the success of each level is mostly based on luck that you'll be able to get the option that will enable you to win. This is the second time I've given this game a chance and it's more true now than the first time I played it. I've since deleted it. Play another game that doesn't waste your time.,22-10-2024 20:00,2,a9bc01f9-61d5-4c58-b74f-ca4a42c00113,FALSE,FALSE
Brandon Kelson,"Pretty good game, cool graphics, and challenging levels. My only issue is that when I choose to invite for a global challenge, I keep getting disconnected.

Matt Stanley,"Typical money hungry game. Difficulty level spikes up so fast you can't progress without throwing money at it and those ""first purchase"" options are ridiculous. 40$ for a character skin that barely increases your chance of winning. GTFO with your BS devs. Sad part is the game is cool, but just gets to an unplayable point without throwing away money on diamonds to have a CHANCE of winning decent gear, which btw is .005% as shown right on they're loot box drop rates.

You can't even grind to get them, they're simply unavailable without spending. Leveling up what you can get is so unbalanced. It costs so many resources. They do that so you spend in micro transactions. I've seen unbalanced games before, but this is truly insane. It's too bad, it could be a great game.

To ""casually"" enjoy the game, you're stuck spending $10 a month to avoid ads, have unlimited auto-runs, and avoid wasted stamina.

Dean Swindler Jr.,"this game is mildly entertaining. I really don't like how some ""upgrades "" actually hurt your damage rating..... it is a pain to keep up with the overwhelming amount of zombies as it is. there is way too large of a variety of upgrades for each weapon as well. then there's the xp.

je bb,Game balance is terrible. Half the skills are useless. Game variety relies on randomness of which skill selections are available. If you get too many useless skills you know you're going to lose and it's just faster to restart. either allow more focused skill paths/selections or strengthen the weak skills no one plays with unless they are forced to because of bad luck.

Napalm Angel,enjoyable slow build up game with lots of little things to keep busy. downside is the math they have after the elite kill and the random pick between one and 4 skills to upgrade is really the problem with the game. it could be one both elite kills and sometimes you get 2 or 4. but they need to change it to 2 of your personal choice. I noticed the math is skewed in their favor. as if you don't level your gun it always put one gun skill in and picks that one skill.

SomBody *sargas*,game seems poorly balanced. can complete a level perfect all the way to failing miserably because of random skill upgrades. primary damage source is gun and I have gone up to 2/3 of the way through a level and not gotten a single gun skill. would be better if you could strategize by setting up skills in combos and progression levels. graphics are decent but overall not a lot of fun to play and seems very grinding,04-06-2024 16:58,2,ef498560-d4fd-4ff6-83cc-4101fda6e545,FALSE,TRUE

Stephen D,*** can we get rid of the congratulatory announcement banner. It gets in the way.*** Great game no forced ads like other greedy devs out there. The rewards are ok. I think the armor needs to have merge capabilities as well.

Steven Hartling,So far I'm really enjoying the game. I like that you didn't try and squeeze in some base building BS. But I will say that there is a severe lack of explanation regarding the way equipment and gems merging and upgrading works. I find myself guessing if what I'm doing going is right. But other than my own stupidity the game is great.,19-05-2024 03:37,4,9e9f71a4-44bf-488c-b6f0-55d7bb6ad7e7,FALSE,FALSE
